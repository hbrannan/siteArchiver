  - Understanding a componentâ€™s contract: defines the expected behavior of your component and
    what assumptions are reasonable to have about its usage
      - What it renders  - props  - state held  - response to user interactions
      - context rendered in  - side effects as a part of component lifecycle
      - performance of methods called on instance  -

  Test shouldn't need to exactly duplicate app.
  Test shouldn't duplicate library code.
  Trivial or important detail? Does this aspect affect the component's public API?
